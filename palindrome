Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


code:

bool isPalindrome(int x) {
    long int a=x,q,r,s=0;
    if(x<0)
    {
        return false;
    }
    
    while(x!=0)
    {
        r=x%10;
        s=s*10+r;
        x=x/10;
    }
    if(a==s)
    {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
